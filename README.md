# pnglitch-java-cli

As a final project for CS class in highschool I made a program that "glitches"
PNG image files. I made a couple versions of this program. One CLI verson
written in C, another C version that works over FastCGI, and finally this early
version written in java.

I totally forgot that I made this, I stumbled upon it while digging through
some old files. I figure I should archive it on github before I accidentally
delete it.
